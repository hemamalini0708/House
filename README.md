**House Price Prediction using Multi-Linear Regression**

**Demo:** https://www.loom.com/share/71d2af9e5360420fb60317230d09a249?sid=82887d59-4130-48a3-a93c-887ec115cbe4

Built a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate house prices based on features like bedrooms, floors, and location.

Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Seaborn & Matplotlib to analyze feature distributions.

Trained & evaluated the model using Sklearn with an R² score of X.XX and reduced RMSE to $XXX,XXX.

Saved the model using Joblib, making it deployable in real-world applications.
